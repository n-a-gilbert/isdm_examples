# Data & code for examples of the 3 models in Gilbert et al., "Integrating harvest and camera trap data to improve species distribution models"

### NOTE: Using NIMBLE

These models are written in NIMBLE, a language derived from BUGS. Unlike previous programs (WinBUGS, JAGS), NIMBLE models are programmable objects in R, but are compiled in C++ for speed. Therefore, prior to installing NIMBLE, you must have Rtools installed so the code can be compiled. Please see the [NIMBLE website](https://r-nimble.org/download) for instructions
